## Predicitng-Rocket-Launches
#
# PROJECT OVERVIEW #
#
## This project was part of the:
# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate w/ Coursera Capstone. 
#
## This GitHub Repository is designed to showcase the steps that were taken to accomplish the goals of predicting the success of rocket launches based off multiple variables such as launch location, weather, pay load size and more. 
#
## Each section of this repository will consist of the code used for each step along the journey of going from raw data, to a predictive model with a dashboard of past attempts, followed up with a data analysis report show casing the results and derived meaning. 
#
#This Repository is to act as a hub for the code used, provided in a clean format for easy duplication, deeper analysis, future projects, or just a simple review.
